# Apple-haptics
What is this? :
This is a personal case study idea. The thought came after watching the F1 Haptics Trailer by Apple. It made me feel the video, not just watch it. I am exploring how haptics (vibrations) can make action and horror movies more immersive, especially in India.

Why this idea? :
In India, people love action, thriller, and horror content. Apple TV is not as popular here yet. Haptics could be one special feature that makes people curious. It adds a physical layer to the storyâ€”a feeling. This could be useful for making Apple TV more unique in this market.

What this project is about :

- Studying how Apple Core Haptics works (non-technical view)

- Understanding how scenes and moments are turned into haptic signals

- Imagining how this could be used in movies, beyond trailers

- Thinking about product, market, and audience side

- Not building anything right now. This is more of a concept and research idea. It may turn into a deeper case study or idea paper.

Goal : To explore how haptics can change the way we experience content. Focus is on India now, but it could work globally later. Combining product, user behavior, and simple tech ideas together.

Thanks for reading!
